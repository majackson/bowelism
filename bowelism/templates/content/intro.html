            <p>I'm a UK-based Software Engineering Manager based in Bristol and London. I thrive in Engineering organisations at the intersection of technology, people, and process.</p>
            <p>Prior to Engineering Leadership, I worked for more than ten years as a backend contributor, most significantly within the Python ecosystem, but at times I have worked full-stack and even had a brief stint as a mobile Engineer. I have built software for a range of different industries, including finance, broadcasting, transport, and fashion.</p>
