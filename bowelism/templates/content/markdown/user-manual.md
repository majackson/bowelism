I first came across "Manager READMEs" and "Personal User Manuals" in my role at Tarabut. They are a great way to "soft introduce" managers to new teams and individuals, giving an opportunity to build familiarity in a comfortable context.

## My Background
Prior to my career as a manager, I operated for more than ten years as a Backend Engineer, most significantly working with the Python stack. I worked in a range of different industries, including broadcasting, fashion, transport and fintech. Throughout my career I have almost exclusively worked for startups. I have always loved startups for the energy and required dynamism that emerges from working in lean teams against rapidly changing environments and industry conditions.


## My approach

### How I Work

My office hours are usually 9am-5:30pm, and outside of meetings, you can expect me to be responsive in those hours. Outside of working hours I am willing to be contacted in emergencies - please use this responsibly!

I aim to respond to Slack messages which need a response within an hour, and emails within a day.

Living in Bristol, on days when I commute in, I will struggle to be responsive/attend meetings in the first hour of the day.

### Feedback
I'm a big believer in continuous feedback as a driver for continuous improvement. Sometimes feedback can feel scary and can elicit a defensive response. But fundamentally, feedback is what helps us improve, and ideally brings us to a positive outcome for everyone. I aim to create conditions where giving and receiving feedback feels safe, easy, and rewarding.

Fundamentally, feedback is also _two way_. So if you ever have any feedback for me, I encourage and will make space for you to bring it to me to address.

### 1:1s (One-to-ones)

I consider 1:1s to be one of the most important meetings in my calendar - they are my opportunity to be close to individuals, and really "touch grass" in terms of how we are doing, where people's concerns are, and what problems could be on the horizon. 

I'll hold 1:1s with my direct reports, as well as stakeholders to the teams I support. With 1:1s with reports, I aim for the agenda to be driven by the reportee. This is your space to bring me your concerns, ideas, and thoughts: ask me anything! I also aim for 1:1s to have space for two-way feedback, whenever it might be necessary. At times I will directly ask you for feedback on how I am doing, but even if I don't ask, know that feedback on my management and support is always welcome.

I'm aware that different reports will be comfortable with different frequencies of 1:1 cadences. Understanding the right cadence for each person will form part of the first 1:1 conversations we will have. In really busy periods, I might cut back on 1:1 frequency in order to make space for other priorities. When this happens, you can expect me to communicate this clearly, and you can be assured that I'll never cut back on them entirely. In cases where I do cut back, I'll seek to restore 'normal service' as soon as I can.

### Process and Software Development

I'm an advocate of **people over process**, and encourage the teams I support to continually revise and develop our working process in order to best serve the team in moving fast, and shipping quickly, reliably, and safely.

In the past, I've had success working in scrum-like and kanban-like process formations. But I believe that teams are as unique as the people that compose them, and I don't believe in any "one size fits all" development process. So when I'm supporting your team, you can expect for me to advocate for us to take the time to periodically revise and refine our working processes together. In instances when I perceive the team to be experiencing problems, missing deliveries, or otherwise struggling, you can expect me to be more direct in debugging and making process improvement suggestions. Even in these cases, I will be soliciting your feedback throughout and I always want to hear your perspective, especially if you disagree with my direction.

### When things go wrong

We aim for things to go right, but we should plan to mitigate the times when the worst happens!

In the event that you have bad news to bring me - please bring it sooner rather than later. This gives us both the opportunity to take the right corrective actions faster. I can also promise that I'll aim to be understanding even when you feel you have made mistakes. I'm a big believer in psychological safety as an enabler to a constructive engineering culture, and being at ease talking about our own mistakes is a significant part of that.

### Work/life balance

I am convinced that in order to get the most from ourselves during our working lives, it's important that we all take adequate time to recharge in between. As a manager, I'm always listening for signals of "burnout" in my teams, and encouraging team members to make good use of their annual leave allowance to mitigate. Of course, one of the best ways of encouraging sustainable working behaviours is by modelling them myself – so you can expect me to take at least two longer breaks (at least a week long) per year, and during that time I'll be planning to minimise my contact. Apart from a desire to "recharge my batteries", this also creates a great great conditions to build resilience within my teams. I don't want any team members – myself included – to be singularly depended upon for critical operations. 


### Outside of work

Outside of working life I aim to spend a good amount of time with my hobbies away from a screen!

**Reading** – and reading fiction, specifically – is a big part of my "unwinding" process at the end of the work day. I find it a great way to set myself up for good-quality rest, which in turn supports my day-to-day work. I've recently been working my way through Noah Hawley's novels – he's best known as writer & showrunner of the Fargo TV series. I'm also a big fan of superhero fiction and have been reading comics & graphic novels as long as I can remember, with Jonathan Hickman and Grant Morrison being my recent favourite superhero writers.

**Hiking** is a great complement to a tech career. Enjoying the world outdoors is a great counterpoint to many hours spent understanding and working through problems presented on a screen. I recently had a great time hiking the West Highland Way in Scotland with my girlfriend.

**DIY** - A few years ago now I bought a house in Bristol that needed _a lot_ of work, and have been embarking on the long process of fixing it up ever since. This was a whole new set of skills for me, and hugely out of my comfort zone. I have learned a lot along the way!
