The background to this page shows the constantly-streaming server logs of the web server which serves it. The logs are streamed directly from nginx over a web socket to all connected clients. *Your* requests will also be highlighted in a dark-green colour.

Why? well, I think it looks quite cool. The idea came about when I was reading about [Bowellist architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowellism), where the "guts" of a building (ducts, piping, lifts) are placed on the exterior of a building in order to maximise space on the inside. I wondered: what would a "bowellist" technical architecture look like? This led to a few ideas, but the ultimate implementation is the page you're looking at, which I think also captures the interest of any technically-minded folk who land on this page.

This was a particularly fun piece to put together when in normal software engineering instances, we work hard to _never_ expose "inside data" to the outside, and our systems are specifically designed to make this difficult. Building "against the grain" here produced some fun challenges.

This also gave me an opportunity to try django-channels, Django's websocket-streaming tooling. I also made use of Python, Django, and Redis. The frontend was generated by Lovable, which takes some bullying to get to generate static code instead of React/TypeScript components.
